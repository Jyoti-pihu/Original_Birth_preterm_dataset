# Original_Birth_preterm_dataset
Original new Birth preterm dataset and modeling with classic machine learning. 
Data set has been gathered from signal of Electro histogram of 58 mothers. 
The tabular original data set has been extracted from the electro-histogram signal

By this signal can detect whether the baby is preterm or non-preterm.
From research in the university of science and research of Tehran, the tabular features have been extracted from 58 signals.
The dataset is original Binary classified with 58 data each data has been mined from the signal of electro histogram in 1000 seconds
The extracted features:
Count Contraction: the size of Contraction(integer)
Lenght of Contraction: the length of Contraction(integer)
Standard deviation: The standard deviation of signal(Float)
Entrupy: The entrupy of signal(Integer)
Contraction Time: the time of Contraction(Integer)
Output target: Preterm(1) or not preterm(0)
Dataset is classified binary
